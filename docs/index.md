TO DO

## Get started 
{: .mb-3}

Let's start and see how you can build the whole ecosystem up!

1. Firs of all, you need to **deploy the microservice**. To do so, follow the [Microservice installation guide](/certification-system/microservice/#installation).

2. Test the microservice by [Installing the CLI](/certification-system/cli/#installation-and-usage). Test any API you have in hand!

3. Once you've verified that the microservice is up and running, you can now [deploy the SPA](/ide-extensions/overview/#spa-deployment) that the API Hub extension will use later on.

4. [Install the API Hub](/ide-extensions/overview/#installation) in VS Code or IntelliJ and [configure it](/ide-extensions/api-hub/#settings) to work with the certification service.

5. [Install the Quick Fix]() to design faster!
