When using Spectral for linting OpenAPI contracts, we encountered that it doesnâ€™t suggest any quick fix for the linted error. So that is how this extension started.

{: .note}
Since this extension is based on Spectral, the Quick fix **only works for OpenAPI contracts**.

## Settings

This extension does not need any settings. Just download it and start enjoying it ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage

To use it, open an API contract on VS Code, and if it has errors or warnings, your code will have **underlined text**. This happens because Spectral founds issues on your contract that break the API guidelines.

To **correct the warnings/errors**, put the cursor above the highlighted text, and you will see a tooltip with all the possible corrections that can be done - you can add, modify, or delete code.

If you **click on one of the options**, you quickly fix the code. Nice and easy.
