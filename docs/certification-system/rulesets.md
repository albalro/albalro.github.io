<br>

`security.yaml`

| Rule | Description |
| --	| -- |
| allowed-auth-methods | The API operation uses HTTP authentication method that is not included in IANA Authentication Scheme Registry |
| allowed-verbs | Use always HTTP verbs to refer to actions in urls |
| array-required-properties | Array size should be limited to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks. This can be done using `maxItems` |
| empty-schema | The schema is empty. This means that your API accepts any JSON values. Or payload does not have any properties defined |
| empty-schema-headers | Define schemas for all header objects to restrict what input or output is allowed |
| ensure-auth | Authentication SHOULD support Basic and Bearer type |
| ensure-security-schemes | The security field of your API contract does not list any security schemes to be applied |
| global-security | Use the security field on the global level to set the default authentication requirements for the whole API |
| implicit-grant-oauth2 | Do not use implicit grant flow in OAuth2 authentication |
| negotiate-auth | Do not use the security scheme negotiateAuth |
| no-additional-properties-defined	 | While forbidding additionalProperties can create rigidity and hinder the evolution of an API - eg making it hard to accept new parameters or fields. It is possible that this flexibility can be used to bypass the schema validator and force the application to process unwanted information |
| numeric-required-properties-max-min	 | Numeric values should be limited in size to mitigate resource exhaustion |
| oauth1-auth | One or more global security schemes in your API allows using OAuth 1.0 authentication |
| resource-owner-password-auth | The API operation uses resource owner password grant flow in OAuth2 authentication |
| response-schema-defined | You have not defined any schemas for responses that should contain a body. Only acceptable if the returned HTTP status code is 204 or 304 (no content allowed for these codes), see RFC 7231 and RFC 7232 |
| schema-mandatory-parameters | One or more parameters in your API do not have schemas defined. All parameters must have either schema or content defined to restrict what content your API accepts|
| security-empty | One or more of the objects defined in the global security field contain an empty security requirement |
| security-scopes-defined | OAuth2 security requirement requires a scope not declared in the referenced security scheme |
| server-https | Set all server objects to support HTTPS only so that all traffic is encrypted |
| string-parameters-required-maxLength | String should be limited and with a maxLength to avoid out of format inputs by attackers |
| string-properties-required-maxLength | String should be limited and with a maxLength to avoid out of format inputs by attackers |
