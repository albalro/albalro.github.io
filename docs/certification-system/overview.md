A compound of a microservice, its API, and a CLI.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The Certification System is based on the following pieces:

- [x] **Certification Service** - The microservice that servs the API along with the other tools.
- [x] **Rulesets** - A compound of rules that can replace and extend the default rules already existing in the microservice.
- [x] **API CLI** - The CLI that interacts with the service from terminal.
- [x] **API Hub** - The set of tools that help you design your APIs from your IDE.
